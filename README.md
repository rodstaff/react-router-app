This tutorial is in principle very helpful to understand React Routing.  However, one has to look at the folder structure, the file naming, the .json/.config files and the code itself very carefully to see many areas for improvement.  Unless you do so, the app may not work at the start and may look a little bit strange, so look in detail.  The code presented here have been modified and refactored to some extent.  

* I have also added ES5, ES6 and ES7 code versions (ref:  "Youtube:  React+Redux+ES6+ES7" by Carl Bulow) for reference and comparison to help distinguish among the variants which can be confusing to beginners. These are not part of the code.

Please take look and enjoy coding!

This tutorial is in principle very helpful to understand React Routing.  However, one has to look at the folder structure, the file naming, the .json/.config files and the code itself very carefully to see many areas for improvement.  Unless you do so, the app may not work at the start and may look a little bit strange, so look in detail.  Although not even close to being optimized, the code presented here have been modified to some extent.  Please take look and enjoy!
